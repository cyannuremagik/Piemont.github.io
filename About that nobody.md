# About
I am an epidemiologist currently PhD candidate in a sizeable medical centre in the Netherlands. My research is looking at the use of geospatial (exposome, location, infrastructure, built-up area, etc) to improve patient-level prediction. 
The simple answers to the very difficult questions: "What is going to happen to me?"


Prior to that I worked at the [KIT Royal Tropical Institute](www.kit.nl), an amazing place filled with amazing people with the mission to make this world a bit better than it was the day before. For them I worked as an epidemiologist advisor and travelled and collaborated with wonderful people from many different places, especially sub-Saharan Africa. I have fond memories of working there and working in different cultures. I am very definite about my work having an impact and sure hope I can help again those who tirelessly do their utmost to improve the life of their community.


Enough of the work bioblurb though. 
I love mountains, yet I live in the Netherlands with an altitude below sea level and about **0 mountains** anywhere to be seen. I love trailrunning, nature is a full blast and amazement to me, be it trees, flowers, plant, or animals. I love trailrunning in the mountains, and yet **I have vertigo very quickly**. There is only one way forward, and it goes up. 


Each step is a step closer to your objective, and further way from the start. The first step isn't the hardest, it's the few first ones, together, that are the real obstacle. Similarly to how quickly the slope of a mountain may increase, before you reach a plateau and a more suitable pace for yourself.


I sure hope this place will help some of the things I have always wanted to start to actually start. A place where my insane capacity to procrastinate and to overwhelm myself with too many things to look at *(hint: they are related)* can find some rest.

*Curiosity killed the cat*, the saying goes, *and satisfaction brought it back*. But this cat is going to die a lot more than 9 times if it keeps on being so curious.
