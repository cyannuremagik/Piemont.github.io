# The foot of the mountain

Welcome to my personal persistent notebook. 
In here you will find a collection of article written specifically for this blog. It will cover anything that I deem interesting about ecology, public health, urban challenges & design, political regimes, animal welfare, and trail running. There will be a collection of definitions that I find interesting and that I may use here and there. And probably some coding too

You should rightly wonder who am I to think this could be interesting to anyone else. Well I am arguably a nobody, but find out yourself in [[About that nobody]]. And this place is curiosity driven. As you landed here for a reason, I assume you are curiosity driven yourself.

I sincerely hope you will enjoy your moment here and feel free to reach out.

Daniel
